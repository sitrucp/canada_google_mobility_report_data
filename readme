Google Community Mobility Report										
Canada Province & Territories 

Location history visit & length of stay change compared to baseline										

<a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/">Google Community Mobility Report	</a> has a filter by Country or Country State, Province. 

This data is based on filter for "Canada" which results in pdf file with summary section for all of Canada and separate sections for each Canadian province and territory.

I copied the entire pdf text and pasted into blank Notepad++ file. This results in set of text. 

All lines of text were deleted except those relevant to each Canadian province and territory. 

This text file then became source for Excel Power Query data connection. Using variety of Power Query transformations the data was transformed into columns for date of report, province/territory name, and mobility report category and value.

This transformed data was then used to generate Excel Pivot Table and Charts to visualize mobility report data by province/territory and report date.
