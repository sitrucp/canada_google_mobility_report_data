**Google Community Mobility Report - Canada Province & Territories **
Location history visit & length of stay change compared to baseline 

This data was obtained from <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/">Google Community Mobility Report</a> webpage. Page was set to filter for "Canada" which results in PDF file. PDF with summary section for all of Canad followed by separate sections for each Canadian province and territory.

The entire PDF text was copied (eg ctrl-a on PDF page) and pasted (ctrl-v) into blank text file. Aall lines of text were deleted except those relevant to each Canadian province and territory. 

The resulting text file was data source for Excel Power Query data connection that uses a variety of Power Query transformations to render text into tabular format including columns for date of report, province/territory name, and mobility report category and value.

This transformed data was then used to generate Excel Pivot Table and Charts to visualize mobility report data by province/territory and report date.

As new Canada Google Community Mobility Reports are available, additional report text can be appended to the existing data to do trend and comparative analysis.
